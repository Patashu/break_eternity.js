# break_eternity.js

A Javascript numerical library to represent numbers as large as 10^^1e308 and as 'small' as 10^-(10^^1e308). This is a sequel to break_infinity.js, my other library which maxes out at 1e1e308 ( https://github.com/Patashu/break_infinity.js ) and its C# port ( https://github.com/Razenpok/BreakInfinity.cs ). Despite handling a wider range of numbers, execution time is comparable (within 2x/0.5x as fast as break_infinity.js in testing) and it has the same interface, so it can be used as a drop-in replacement for break_infinity.js and decimal.js.

Now with arbitrary real height and base handling in your favourite hyper 4 operators (tetrate, iterated exponentiation, iterated logarithm, super logarithm, super root) and even in hyper 5 operators (though hyper 5 operators quickly exceed the library's number limits)! Using an analytic approximation for bases <= 10, but linear approximation for bases > 10 (but there's options to use the linear approximation everywhere if you need consistent behavior) for hyper 4 operators.

The internal representation is as follows: `Decimal.fromComponents(sign, layer, mag)` === `sign*10^10^10^ ... (layer times) mag`. So a layer 0 number is just `sign*mag`, a layer 1 number is `sign*10^mag`, a layer 2 number is `sign*10^10^mag`, and so on. If `layer > 0` and `mag < 0`, then the number's exponent is negative, e.g. `sign*10^-10^10^10^ ... mag`.

- sign is -1, 0 or 1.
- layer is a non-negative integer.
- mag is a Number, normalized as follows: if it is above 9e15, log10(mag) it and increment layer. If it is below log10(9e15) (about 15.954) and layer > 0, Math.pow(10, mag) it and decrement layer. At layer 0, sign is extracted from negative mags. Zeroes (`this.sign === 0 || (this.mag === 0 && this.layer === 0)`) become `0, 0, 0` in all fields. Any infinities have both mag and layer as positive Infinity.

Create a Decimal with `new Decimal(String or Number or Decimal)` or with `Decimal.fromComponents(sign, layer, mag)`. Use operations

IMPORTANT NOTE TO PEOPLE CONVERTING FROM break_infinity.js: log/log2/log10/ln now return Decimal not Number! You'll also need to reconsider your string parsing/displaying functions and consider moving e/exponent calls to absLog10. Support for very small numbers has finally been added, so things like tickspeed multiplier being 1e-400 will be fine now!

Functions you can call include `abs, neg, round, floor, ceil, trunc, add, sub, mul, div, recip, mod, cmp, cmpabs, max, min, maxabs, minabs, log, log10, ln, pow, root, factorial, gamma, exp, sqrt, tetrate, iteratedexp, iteratedlog, layeradd10, layeradd, slog, ssqrt, lambertw, linear_sroot, pentate, penta_log, linear_penta_root` and more! Javascript operators like `+` and `*` do not work - you need to call the equivalent functions instead. Note that all these functions return new Decimals - they do not mutate the original Decimal.

Accepted input formats to new Decimal or Decimal.fromString (X, Y, and N represent numbers):

```
M === M
eX === 10^X
MeX === M*10^X
eXeY === 10^(XeY)
MeXeY === M*10^(XeY)
eeX === 10^10^X
eeXeY === 10^10^(XeY)
eeeX === 10^10^10^X
eeeXeY === 10^10^10^(XeY)
eeee... (N es) X === 10^10^10^ ... (N 10^s) X
(e^N)X === 10^10^10^ ... (N 10^s) X
N PT X === 10^10^10^ ... (N 10^s) X
N PT (X) === 10^10^10^ ... (N 10^s) X
NpX === 10^10^10^ ... (N 10^s) X
FN === 10^10^10^ ... (N 10^s)
XFN === 10^10^10^ ... (N 10^s) X
X^Y === X^Y
X^^N === X^X^X^ ... (N X^s) 1
X^^N;Y === X^X^X^ ... (N X^s) Y
X^^^N === X^^X^^X^^ ... (N X^^s) 1
X^^^N;Y === X^^X^^X^^ ... (N X^^s) Y
```

# Use

The library exports a single function object, Decimal, the constructor of Decimal instances.

It accepts a value of type number, string or Decimal.

```javascript
x = new Decimal(123.4567);
y = new Decimal("123456.7e-3");
z = new Decimal(x);
x.equals(y) && y.equals(z) && x.equals(z); // true
```

The methods that return a Decimal can be chained.

```javascript
x.dividedBy(y).plus(z).times(9).floor();
x.times("1.23456780123456789e+9").plus(9876.5432321).dividedBy("4444562598.111772").ceil();
```

A list of functions is provided earlier in this readme, or you can read through index.d.ts for a more detailed list.

If you want to just mess around with the library to try it, download break_eternity.js, add <script> </script> tags to the beginning and end respectively, rename it break_eternity.html, open it in chrome, right click -> inspect, go to the Javascript Console, and type in and execute whatever commands you want. Enjoy!
